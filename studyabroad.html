                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                      The UC San Diego Study Abroad Website has a very large amount of information that is not well organized.
                      It is difficult for users to find important information they might need when considering studying abroad.
                      When interviewing UCSD students, we found that many either were redirected to another site to obtain
                      information on studying abroad, or students went directly to the websites for the programs that they
                      were interested, having never even heard of the Study Abroad Website. As a part of COGS 187A at UCSD,
                      I along with two other team members created a low fidelity prototype, redesigning parts of the UCSD
                      Study Abroad Website using Balsamiq. We condensed navigation into six main categories, rather than ten
                      that are currently on the Study Abroad site: Applying, Programs, Finances, Students, Alumni, and Contact.
                      Most students as well as parents went to the website to look at programs, deadlines, and types of financial
                      aid that were available, so we made these core elements of navigation. We also brought a very visual
                      approach, placing headliner banners above the fold on pages, since it was previously very confusing to
                      users what deadlines there were and what steps users had to take to apply to things such as financial aid.
                      These banners would have deadlines and reminders, as well as news from the Study Abroad office.

                    <h4>My Role</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">I worked with two other classmates on this project. We each did equal amounts of
                      interviewing, research, and competitive analysis. I was responsible for redesigning the Programs pages
                      in particular.

                    <h4 class="section-heading">User Research</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">We interviewed a minimum of 4 students each to gather data from
                      different types of personas: students who are interested in studying abroad, students
                      who are currently abroad, students who have studied abroad and returned, and parents.
                      We found that many students did not even use the study abroad website, and in fact,
                      they went straight to the UC Education Abroad Program (UCEAP) website instead. The
                      UCEAP is a study abroad program that is used on the UC wide system.

                  <h4 class="section-heading">Competitive Analysis</h4>
                  <p class="text-faded">We compared UCSD's study abroad website with study abroad websites of other
                    such as UCLA and UC Berkeley, comparing different aspects of their site, like navigation, labels,
                    footers, and content layout.

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                  <h4 class="section-heading">Prototyping & Solution</h4>
                  <p class="text-faded">The first aspect we sought to redesign was the main navigation. Our group
                    knew from the start that we wanted our website to be as minimalist as possible, yet also display
                    all the necessary content for our users. Through our competitive analysis, we found certain
                    websites, such as UC Davis’s, had too many top tabs, versus UCLA’s that had fewer amounts.
                    During our think-aloud interview, a few of our interviewees mentioned that upon visiting the
                    UCSD study abroad website, they felt that the homepage was too cluttered with excessive information
                    and tabs. It was difficult for them to know where to look. Knowing this, we did not want for our
                    top navigation to limit our tabs to be 6 tabs. Furthermore, we had a hard time deciding what
                    navigation links we wanted to include on the navigation bar. Based on our use cases as well as
                    competitive analysis, we were able to decide on several tabs that we wanted. However, once we
                    started working on the low-fidelity Balsamiq mockup we soon realized that we needed to cut down
                    on the tabs and only add the most relevant ones. For example, we scrapped the “Faculty” tab during
                    our wireframing collaboration since we did not find a use case for faculty through our user cases
                    and interviews, in favor of a “Home” tab to provide clarity and transparency in terms of getting
                    back to the home page, instead of assuming the user would know that they could go home through
                    the breadcrumbs or by clicking on the UCSD Study Abroad icon/logo. In summary, having enough tabs
                    in the navigation bar while keeping it as minimalist as possible was a tough decision in itself due
                    to the factors we had to consider throughout our redesign.
                    <br><br>
                    During the process of integrating our pages, we also had to refer back to our findings from our user
                    interviews in order to truly understand what the purpose of each page would be. For example, in terms
                    of our “Programs” page, our group had to decide whether we wanted its purpose to be a page for users
                    to learn about the various types of programs UCSD had to offer, or a page for users to find a specific
                    study abroad program (ex: program in Tokyo, Japan). In addition, while it is easy to provide a lot of
                    informative content (i.e. deadlines, announcements, event informations, etc.) onto a singular page, it
                    is difficult to prioritize which of the information we want to showcase that would cater to our user’s
                    specific needs. For example, in our “Applying” page, we mentioned that we originally had a section that
                    briefly introduced a specific study abroad program. However, we wanted to focus more heavily on the
                    application process, rather than informing users about the details of a program. One decision that our
                    group had to make was to remove that section altogether and instead add a visual timeline that helped
                    users get a better understanding on how and when to apply. Our group also prioritized our section on
                    “Important Dates & Deadlines” because we felt that this was more relevant as to what a user would expect
                    when clicking on an “Applying” page.
