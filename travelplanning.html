                    <p class="text-faded">
                      As a part of COGS 102C, we focused on a problem surrounding a certain topic, which in this case was travel
                      planning. We focused our problem on budgeting with college students. Through extensive research, we found
                      that budgeting was a core problem in travel planning to college students. We developed various prototypes
                      as solutions to help with budgeting, such as a visual tool for users to really see how much of their budget
                      is being allocated to various aspects of their trip.

                      Studio. We each completed equal amounts of interviewing, research, and competitive analysis.

                  <h4 class="section-heading">The Problem</h4>
                  <p class="text-faded">We started out looking at travel planning for college students as our design
                    opportunity. With this in mind, we went through a series of need-finding interviews, where we hoped
                    to learn more about travel planning as an overall process and find out where people encountered problems.
                    After these interviews, we aggregated our data and created an affinity diagram. Our affinity diagram
                    led us to realize that there were a lot of problems we could tackle within travel planning and that we
                    should narrow down our problem space.
                    <br><br>
                    We went through a second round of interviews to look at specifically how people planned. We had observed
                    that travel planning was a very complicated process and we wanted to know what made import so complicated.
                    Why did travel planning necessitate the usage of an abundance of different tools and was there any way we
                    could improve how people planned their trips. We wanted to see what items they prioritized and why.
                    <br><br>
                    When we looked at our research again, we realized that we had misinterpreted our data. The complicated
                    nature of travel planning was not the problem we were looking for. Rather, it was a symptom that resulted
                    from trying to travel plan with a budget. We redefined our problem space once again to travel budgeting.
                    For many college students, budget is the limiting factor for everything when it comes to traveling (flights,
                    hotels, etc.). Students in particular don’t really have a disposable income, so their budget is smaller and
                    becomes a real obstacle to traveling.

                    <h4 class="section-heading">User Research</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">At the beginning of our research process, we began conducting standard
                      interviews to better understand people’s general travel planning process. As we were able
                      to gather data on people’s travel planning process, we also took note of our interviewee’s
                      ages, sources of income, and how they thought about their trip in relation to money. Initially,
                      we assumed that people our age, college students and recent graduates, were primarily budget
                      travelers and had little money to spend on traveling. Yet, through our data we found that this
                      was not the only case. Though our primary audience consisted of young adults, their access to
                      money varied. Most people described themselves as the “broke, college student.” Traveling was
                      something they’d want to do, but it was limited because they either have little to no source of
                      income or rely on an allowance from their parents. In one specific case, one college student
                      mentioned that his group wanted to travel to Japan but realized it would be too much so opted
                      for traveling to Seattle, a cheaper option within the United States. When interviewing recent
                      graduates who already had jobs, we found that they were more willing and eager to travel because
                      of their stable source of income. They didn’t have to rely on their parent’s money or heavily
                      consider their other friend’s budgets either. Their want to travel was more concrete and reasonable
                      because they had the means to do so. Yet, they were still budget-minded since their income didn’t
                      allow for excessive spending as they still had to pay for bills and student loans. A less common
                      case we found, though still significant, was that some people who were still in college were somewhat
                      budget-conscious when thinking about traveling, but it was not a huge limiting factor. Their parents
                      were more than willing to spend for their travels, within reason, but since they were still spending
                      their parent’s money, they weren’t looking into luxury spending. From this, we were able to create our
                      three personas as described above.

                  <h4 class="section-heading">Prototyping & Solution</h4>
                  <p class="text-faded">
                    Our first prototype of this solution focused on a budget planning solution that allowed users to
                    visualize how much they’re spending on their trip. Our data revealed that young travelers keep
                    their budget in mind, literally. The mentally store their budget, adding to an ever increasing
                    amount of information they need to manage as they’re planning their travels. With our proposed
                    solution, people would be provided a visual progress bar that allows them to be more conscious
                    about their budget. Our budget “tracker” will be omnipresent throughout their planning process
                    to guide them in making decision that are friendly to their budget. We imagined this tool would
                    come in the form of a Chrome extension or another always-present option such as a Mac app. This
                    tool would live near or on the platform our travelers used most for shopping for options, which
                    most likely means their browser.

                  <p class="text-faded">
                    For our final prototype and solution, we included a budget estimator along with the visualizer,
                    since many students did not know how much they should be spending or how much other people might
                    spend on a trip. This budget estimator gives an average of how much other people spend overall
                    and on certain categories of travel at different levels of spending profiles (low, middle, luxury).
                    People are able to get a sense of how much they should be spending in comparison to others in order
                    to get an idea of the amount they should set their budget at. Because we also observed that many
                    people do not keep track of their expenses during their trip, and how much of their budget is being
                    used, we would like to include a tool in future versions of our solution that will help with this
                    issue as well. Other solutions we thought of were a payment plan for travel, similar to payment plans
                    for a Coachella ticket. Students can book their trip months in advance and pay for their trip monthly
                    instead of all at once. For example, a student would pay $100/mo. For 10 months for a trip to New York
                    City rather than paying $1000 all at once.
