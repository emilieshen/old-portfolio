                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">
                      As a part of COGS 187A: Information Architecture at UC San Diego, two other team
                      mates and I designed a music app, using Spotify and SoundCloud as sources of inspiration for both
                      well designed elements and elements that could use some redesign. We redesigned the experience and steps
                      a user would go through when editing or creating a playlist and for discovering new music. We also
                      redesigned the visual layout of some elements.
                    </p>
                    <h4>My Role</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">I worked with two other classmates on this project. We each interviewed a minimum of
                      4 individuals. We all analyzed these interviews and did research on other music streaming apps. We made
                      comparisons between apps to show what was a good user experience/flow and what was a less good user
                      experience/flow. We also created did an equal amount of work in competitive analysis. In terms of creating
                      the prototype, we created initial sketches of each screen together. I worked on designs for half of the
                      screens in Sketch to import into Invision, which can be viewed by clicking to test the prototype.

                    <h4 class="section-heading">User Research</h4>
                    <p class="text-faded">We conducted user interviews, asking people about their experience
                      with music streaming apps that they use, and observing them as they performed certain tasks
                      within their preferred app, such as creating a playlist, editing a playlist, and finding new
                      music to listen to. We interviewed college students at UC San Diego. We asked them questions
                      about their prefered music app in terms of when they listened to music, what they liked and
                      disliked about the app, and their experience with creating and editing playlists. Through in
                      person interviews and think-alouds, we observed that users have their own specific apps that
                      they prefer for streaming and listening to music; Spotify and SoundCloud seem to be more
                      preferable among our interviewees, however not by an extremely large margin. We also developed
                      various scenarios for users to complete as a think-aloud exercise using their preferred app.

                  <h4 class="section-heading">Prototyping & Solution</h4>
                  <p class="text-faded">We first created very quick prototypes with paper and pen.
                    Because users found it difficult to edit their playlists, we decided to make this
                    experience easier and simpler. In many apps, we found that if a user wanted to delete
                    songs from their playlist, they had to delete each song one at a time, which was very
                    inefficient. Also, there was no error prevention in deleting songs. When a user clicked
                    delete, there was no confirmation to the user on whether or not they wanted to complete
                    the action of deleting that song. We changed this process by creating a checklist type
                    of deletion system, where the user could select multiple songs they wanted to delete.
                    We created a high fidelity prototype using Sketch and Invision. We thought about whether
                    the user should be led back to the page they were on prior to creating a playlist and
                    adding a song to that playlist, or if they should be directed to the newly created playlist.
                    However, we did not want the user to be confused on where they were in terms of navigation,
                    especially when visibility of system status is so important. We decided to keep the user on
                    the screen that they were on prior to creating the playlist. For the navigation bar, it was
                    difficult to choose what options to have. We chose to have Home, Explore, Search, Library,
                    and Profile. SoundCloud includes browsing and search as combined, and Spotify includes browsing
                    and search as separate features. We felt that it was important to keep these two features separate
                    because these are for two different purposes. Browse is for finding new music to listen to and
                    discovering, while search is used to find a specific artist or song. We included Profile as an
                    option in the navigation bar, since we wanted to put some emphasis on the social aspect due to
                    the findings from interviews as mentioned earlier.
                    <br><br>
                    Regarding the Library, we discussed what kind of content that we wanted to display on page and
                    how it would be structured. At first, we only had recently played playlists appear on the page,
                    but we decided that it would be more salient to expand the results and have “recently listened”
                    music listed, whether it be playlists, stations, or artists, to provide more content. This gave
                    the user more freedom to navigate and recall their most recent choices. Originally, we structured
                    our “recent” information in a list format, but realized that using a grid format with larger
                    thumbnails would be more coherent for users, especially for those that are attempting to multitask
                    while listening to music. Many of our interviewees stated that they use music apps while driving,
                    so choosing and pressing on a larger thumbnail with more space area is easier, which also applies
                    to the way our actual playlist page is set up (grid). Additionally, the list items we ended up
                    with were Likes, Playlists, Artists, Songs, and Radio. We came to this conclusion to limit the
                    list items to 5 of the most used categories (according to our interviewees and ourselves, and
                    ones similar across different apps). For editing tracks, we decided to show the process for
                    deleting songs, since this was something all of us were having an issue with in every music
                    app we found. In Spotify, the option to delete songs from a playlist was in a very unexpected
                    place, and while it was where we expected it to be on SoundCloud, it was still a longer process
                    than it had to be. We drew our inspiration from the delete option of the iMessage app, where
                    selecting “Edit” would allow the user to choose which selections they wanted to delete, and
                    then delete them all simultaneously with the press of one button; conversely, other music apps
                    force users to delete items one by one. This follows a more intuitive, efficient process for the
                    user because what would’ve taken them an excessive amount of steps in either SoundCloud or Spotify
                    would only take them a few taps.
